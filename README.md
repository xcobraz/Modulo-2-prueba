My project was about a portfolio layout that was organized into different folders. The main document is in index.html. This is the main page of the website, which only shows an image of the person along with a space for the description, and below the technologies they know how to use. The other two links are contact.html, which sends us the contact form, and portfolio.html.
This shows us some of the projects I've done with their link to the repositories.

The program is stored in a specific CSS folder, within which you can find the CSS styles. Style.css is connected to index.html. Portfolio.css is connected to portfolio.html. Contact.css is connected to contact.html. This way, each page has a connection to different CSS files so you can freely vary the style.

Going a little deeper into the code, it is based on four main tags: header, nav, main, and footer. These tags are present in all three HTML files.

Regarding CSS, styles such as colors, shadows, typography, and transitions were used. Transitions are found on browser buttons, as well as repository links, network icons, and project cards.
The design is adjusted to be responsive using Flexbox Grid and MediaQueries.
